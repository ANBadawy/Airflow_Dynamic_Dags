I created a Django project to handle creating, listing and linking the KPIs, assets and attributes. Also, created an API to take a message body and give a response with the desired result; meaning it can handle any arithmetic or regex equations.

Please Note: When you enter the values of the message body to the API to get a result enter them without a "".
